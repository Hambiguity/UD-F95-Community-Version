####################################Event Changes###########################################


002 Test Map:
	Added Cheat to control the stats of all the characters

013 Home Floor:
	005,012|032:MomStoreEvent
		Made it so mom can't send you to the supermarket during the morning.
	014,005|008:Mom
		Made it so she disappears during the Supermarket scene.
	006,014|30:Babysitter|Event Page 2 & 5 & 6
		Added a else clause to add a variety of dialogue if the sex level is under level 8
016: School Outside:
	009,005|046:EV046
		Added a invisible event next to Recess Mrs J in order to equate the values of the old variables to the new ones to ensure all scenes are possible for the Mrs J's Recess sex so it works with the rewrite.
			This will not activate unless you have the old variables above zero (which is impossible at the moment for anyone whose not cheating.) So this only works for old saves right now but in the future it will work with the new jennings quest.
014 Home Floor 02:
	016,015|SydneySleep and 011,009|Sydney
		Fixed a bug with Sister rage scene by adding a 2 events that allow for the scene to occur at night
	003,013|009:EV009
		Peter now has an avatar for his dialogue during the shower photo scene
015 Home Floor 03:
	006,007|010:EV010 (Wake Up event)
		After the first Morning HJ from Mom she'll now start next to the MC instead of having to sit through her walking up to you slowly. Added Dialogue to event after sex scenes and updated so sprite appears as you wake up.
019 Park South:
	007,010|011:Sarah|Page 2
		Fixed dialogue for when sex level is above 8 and on pure path
022 Playground:
	009,006|005:Kimberly
		Added Extra Requirement to the Hide and Seek to prevent abandonment even when you are at max pure and max corrupt on the Pure Route.

030 Tools Store:
	010,006|004:EV004|Page 2 & 3 & 4
		Fixed getting stuck behind the counter by adding a jump command at the end of the interactions.

033 Miss Amos House:
	013,017|004:Miss Amos Kit
		Added some extra Dialogue to Ms Amos in the Kitchen.

038 School Scene:
	007,009|001:EV001:
		Fixed a lot of scenes and dialogue issues but I can't remember all of them.
			I had to change mrs-j-bj-corrupt to mrs-j-bj-lick-corrupt because mrs-j-bj-lick-corrupt didn't exist before that. I copied the mrs-j-bj-corrupt into a separate file and renamed it to compensate for if there are any unknown scenes that use mrs-j-bj-lick-corrupt.
				The point is it was a complicated issue but it's fixed and it works now.
				If there are no scenes that use mrs-j-bj-corrupt in the future we can delete that file without repercussions	
	006,009|003:EV003|Page 5: (Morning Scenes)
		Fixed 10 Heart scene playing every morning. Should now only play on mondays.
047 Entrance:
	010,007|007:EV007
		Fixed bug where event occurred during the day when walking dizzy home
		
Haven't actually uploaded this yet, got a little overzealous, sorry -NotThatICare
